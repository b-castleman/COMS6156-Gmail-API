# COMS6156-Gmail-API


I simplified this as much as possible. All you need to do to send emails is the following terminal command:

$ node app.js {receiver email} {subject line} {email body}

For example, if I want to send bobsmith@gmail.com an emailed titled "Project Sign-up Deadline" with the body "You must sign up for a project by November 18th!\n\n-Donald", I would do the following:

$ node app.js "bobsmith@gmail.com" "Project Sign-up Deadline" "You must sign up for a project by November 18th!\n\n-Donald"

Let me know if you have any questions!
